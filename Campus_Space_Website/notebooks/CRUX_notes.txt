NOTES FROM CRUX:
Homepage:
- Put the title up in the nav bar instead of home
- BIG CALL TO ACTION BUTTON
    - Potentially also have it in the nav
    - Give people on the website something to click on right away
- Maybe put the photo to the side and have a white background
    - A bit more breathing room
- In the dashboard:

Mission:
- Make sure “CLIMATE COMMITMENT in it for life” in alt text
- Cut “By tracking…” down to 2/3 of the page
- Images: Keep in mind the size with the words once we put them in
    - Maybe use copilot: https://oit.duke.edu/service/microsoft-copilot/

About:
- At the top say 
    - “We use Wifi and CO2 data to ….” as opposed to making them scroll

Combine About and Mission
- Maybe add a Meet the Team page

Track Occupancy:
- Create a 2-tab page where you can choose which types of Wifi visualization you want
