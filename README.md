# Campus_Space_and_Energy



## Overview

This branch is set up to test files before moving them to origin main. It contains several directories:

1. **jupyter:** Contains necessary files to generate heatmap visualization (html) through widgets
2. **api:** Contains Dockerfiles, along with subdirectory "app" and "wifi-app"
3. **db:** Holds the scripts such that if we run the terminal, users can use the scripts without having access to the database
